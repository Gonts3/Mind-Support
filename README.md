Mind-Support
🧠 Project Overview
Mind-Support is a mental health support application built as a group project. It provides accessible tools that help match patients with a counselor specializing in the specific mental health issue that the patient has. The application matches a patient to the counselor with the lowest number of patients. For security all users verify their emails with an OTP and have to sign in when using their account from a separate device.
This README explains how to install, run, and contribute to the project.
